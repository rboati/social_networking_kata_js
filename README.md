# Social Networking Kata
This implementation is written in javascript for fun and experimentation.

The original specifications are available at [Social Networking kata](https://github.com/xpeppers/social_networking_kata_kata).

In this kata I "pushed" Javascript and used it as an OO language to explore this possibility.
So I tried to use a naive form of interfaces.
Javascript is not the perfect language for these tasks especially because it lacks static typing.

Futhermore it was an opportunity to use ES6 modules and check the status of compatibility in node.
